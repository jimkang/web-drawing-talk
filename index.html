      <h2>Bezier curves</h2>

      <p>
        Bezier curves let you form a lot of aesthetically satisfying lines.
        They're a core component of Adobe Illustrator and other drawing
        programs.

        </li>
        <li>tl;dr It's a way of interpolating between the control points.</li>
        <li>Bezier curves are splines.</li>
        <li>
          In a basic cubic Bezier curve, there's two control points, one that
          corresponds with the start of the curve and one that corresponds with
          the end.

      <h2>Paths are flexible.</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to draw an unnameable shape, then paths are the way to go.
        In fact, if you want to draw something that <em>almost</em> looks like a
        nameable shape but has some irregularity or distoration, paths are the
        way to go. e.g:

          There's a canvas analogue to almost every primitive available for SVG.

        </li>
        <li>
          Get a context, which is your JS interface to a canvas element's
          contents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hook into `requestAnimationFrame` or something that uses it to know
          when to draw. Without that, you can tie up the event loop.
        </li>
        <li>Keep track of how much time has passed since the last draw.</li>
        <li>Apply your own transforms to each thing you draw.</li>
        <li>
          Figure out an "object" on the canvas was clicked or not. One way: Have
          an invisible canvas with a different color for each object. On a
          click, find out what color was at the pixel that was clicked.

      <h2>Animating</h2>
      <p>Animating is just drawing something different over time!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          On Canvas, you can animate by:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Drawing something slightly different each frame. How different?
              Usually depends on how much time has passed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          On SVG, you can animate by:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Changing the attributes of an element every frame, similar to
              canvas animation.

            <li>

      <h2>Transforms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Transforms are math done to one or more points. In SVG, they usually
          apply to an element hierarchy. In canvas, they usually apply to a
          context and affect everything drawn to that context.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/setTransform#Syntax"
            >generic matrix APIs</a
          >
          that multiply every point in the target by a 3x3 matrix.
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="media/transform-matrix.jpg" alt="The transform matrix" />
        </li>
        <li>
          There are common transforms, like rotating, scaling, and translating.
          These are sort of like the circle, rect, and line of transforms. The
          browser provides specific methods for these even though you can just
          do it with the generic transform APIs.
        </li>
        <li style="transform: rotate(-10deg)">
          CSS also has transforms, which can apply to normal HTML elements as
          well as SVG.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rotating an image involves a surprising amount of work. If you just
          rotate it, it will rotate around the top left corner.
